# instant-nerdle-solver

A tiny script to (hopefully) resolve an [instant nerdle](https://instant.nerdlegame.com/game).

```
> python main.py

Nerdle (for example: *473=-91):
> *473=-91
Correct green symbol (for example, the 3 in [*473=-91] is in position 4):
> 4

=====================
| * 4 7 [3] = - 9 1 |
=====================

Solution: 1 9 - 3 * 4 = 7 ✔️
```
